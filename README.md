### Hi there! I'm Katelyn Rees. 👋

## About Me
Hello! Welcome to my small corner of the GitHub World. My name is Katelyn Rees, and I am a Junior at the University of Arizona double-majoring in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.

I am passionate about technology, math, design, programming, and, above all, learning! I hope to work and learn within the junction of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, and I am currently excited about robotics, the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, and game design.

Beyond my studies, I play intramural soccer and volleyball at my school, and I enjoy running 🏃‍♀️, reading 📖, playing the piano 🎹, listening to music 🎵, and watching good movies! I love Marvel and aspire to be Tony Stark!

Fun Fact About Me: I can do a backflip! 😄
